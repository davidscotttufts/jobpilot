# JobPilot terminal host

A local .NET process that runs one Claude Code or Codex PTY for the web app. It owns no cloud state: it
launches the provider with the user's JobPilot API environment and relays raw terminal traffic.

## Layout

Each folder is one feature and holds its endpoints, request and response records, and logic.

| Folder | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Hosting/` | DI and middleware, `/healthz` and `/shutdown`, the install layout, the origin allowlist, the `jobpilot://` scheme. |
| `Providers/` | What to launch. `Provider` is the registry; `ClaudeProvider` and `CodexProvider` hold each CLI's arguments and quirks. |
| `Sessions/` | The live session. `TerminalSession` owns it, `PtyProcess` wraps one spawned process, `TerminalRelay` bridges WebSockets. |
| `Pilot/` | The autonomous loop: `PilotLoop` runs cycles, `CycleRunner` runs one, `PilotSession` drives the terminal for it. |
| `Updates/` | `HostUpdater` installs a newer GitHub release; `HostHandoff` passes the port to the relaunched host. |

## Runtime flows

- **Session.** `/sessions/start` calls `TerminalSession.Start`, which prepares the provider's workspace (Codex
  mirrors the bundled skills into `.agents/skills`), builds the `JOBPILOT_*` environment, and spawns a new
  `PtyProcess`. `TerminalRelay` broadcasts output to every WebSocket and keeps a 512 KB replay for reconnects.
- **Pilot.** `/pilot/start` saves `PilotSettings` to `pilot.json`; every save wakes `PilotLoop`. Each cycle
  starts with one `/api/pilot/activity` probe that gates on the server's run-state and gives `CycleRunner` its
  completion baseline. The runner then refreshes the task list. With no tasks it journals the empty cycle
  itself and sleeps, so an idle pilot never wakes the model. With tasks it sends the cycle, waits for the sentinel (or a server-recorded completion the
  TUI garbled), and climbs check-in, skip, then restart when a run looks stuck. `PilotEventListener` holds
  the API's event stream open and wakes the loop when new work can start the next cycle early.
- **Update.** `HostUpdater` downloads the release, moves the running executable aside, and copies the release
  over the install. `HostHandoff.Relaunch` starts the new host, which waits for this one to release the port.
  Only the executable and `plugin/` are the updater's; the rest of the install root may be user state.

## Shared state

- `TerminalSession.sync` guards the current `PtyProcess` and the active provider. Replacing or stopping a
  session disposes its process, which never reports an exit afterwards, so a stale exit cannot stop a newer one.
- `TerminalRelay.sync` orders replay writes against client registration and guards the client map.
- `PilotStore.sync` guards the in-memory settings and serializes the atomic `pilot.json` replacement.
- `PilotLoop.sync` guards the live cycle's cancellation source. The loop publishes it before reading the
  settings, so a stop either cancels that cycle or is seen by its read.

## Invariants

- A stop on request raises one requested exit (for Pilot waiters) and never shows a crash banner.
- `PilotApi` probes and reports never throw except on the caller's own cancellation; a failed probe returns null.
- A wake that leaves the pilot running never interrupts the agent mid-turn; a stop does.
- `pilot.json` keeps its wire shape, is DPAPI-protected on Windows, and is created with mode `0600` on Unix.
