Applying for jobs takes hours. You fill in the same forms, adjust your resume
for every posting, and keep track of who replied. JobPilot gives that work to
an AI agent on your computer. You tell it what kind of job you want. It
searches job boards, tailors your resume for each posting, fills in and sends
the application, writes to recruiters, and keeps track of the replies. The
JobPilot website shows where every application stands.

> You don't need an API key, and there's no usage bill. The agent runs inside
> Claude Code or Codex, so it uses the subscription you already pay for.

The agent works in a normal browser window on your computer, signed in as
you. You can watch it, or leave it alone and check what it did later.

## What it does

- **Applies to jobs.** It searches LinkedIn, Indeed, Hiring Cafe, and other
  boards, and you can add your own. Each job gets a score against your
  resume. It can apply to the jobs you pick, or work through a list on its own
  up to a limit you set. It answers screening questions and writes cover
  letters along the way.
- **Runs without you.** With the Pilot turned on, you write down your goals
  and a daily limit, and it keeps finding jobs, applying, and following up.
  If it needs a decision from you, it sends a notification to your phone.
  Everything else goes into a journal you can read later.
- **Reaches out to people.** It finds the recruiter or hiring manager for a
  job and writes them a personal email or LinkedIn message. If you connect
  Gmail, it reads the replies, matches them to your applications, and
  suggests what to do next. Nothing is sent without your approval.
- **Keeps track.** Every application sits in one list, from applied to offer,
  with charts on top. Each tailored resume is saved as its own PDF, so you
  know which version went to which company.
- **Works on Upwork.** Through Upwork's own connector, it finds jobs, skips
  clients who rarely hire, drafts proposals you send with one click, and
  collects your invitations, offers, and messages.

## Get started

You need a Claude Code or Codex subscription and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
22 or newer.

1. Install the JobPilot plugin in Claude Code or Codex (commands below).
2. Run setup. It installs a small program called the terminal host, starts
   the agent, and opens the dashboard. If the host is already installed, setup
   updates it.
3. [Create an account](https://jobpilot.suxrobgm.net) and upload your resume.
   The agent reads it and fills in your profile.
4. Start a search campaign. Look over the matches, then apply to the ones you
   like, or let an auto-apply campaign handle them.

> Claude Code starts on the latest Sonnet model and Codex on GPT 6 Luna. Bigger
> models use up your weekly limit much faster and don't send any more
> applications. [Here's why](https://jobpilot.suxrobgm.net/docs/faq).

### Install the plugin

#### Claude Code

Run these in Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/suxrobGM/claude-plugins
/plugin install jobpilot@sukhrob-claude-plugins
/jobpilot:setup
```

#### Codex

Run these in a terminal:

```text
codex plugin marketplace add suxrobGM/codex-plugins
codex plugin add jobpilot@sukhrob-codex-plugins
```

Then start a new Codex session and run:

```text
$setup
```

Once setup is done, you can start the agent from the dock on the right side
of the dashboard.

<details>
<summary><b>Install the terminal host without the plugin</b></summary>

Use one of these to install or repair the terminal host without running
setup. The host ships with all the skills and the browser settings the agent
needs. The plugin from the marketplace only exists to run setup the first
time.

- **Windows (PowerShell):**

  ```powershell
  irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suxrobGM/jobpilot/main/apps/terminal/install.ps1 | iex
  ```

- **macOS / Linux:**

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suxrobGM/jobpilot/main/apps/terminal/install.sh | bash
  ```

[getting started guide](https://jobpilot.suxrobgm.net/docs/getting-started).

## Skills

You only ever type one command:

```text
/jobpilot:setup     # Claude Code
$setup              # Codex
```

It installs the terminal host, starts the agent, and opens the dashboard. If
the host is already installed, it updates it, so you can run it again whenever
you want to update or fix your install.

Everything else starts from a button in the dashboard. JobPilot passes the
matching skill to the agent, and you can watch it work in the dock:

| In the dashboard                             | What the agent does                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| New campaign → Search only (`search`)        | Searches a board and scores every job against your resume.               |
| New campaign → Auto-apply (`auto-apply`)     | Searches, then applies to matches one at a time, up to your limit.       |
| New campaign → Networking (`networking`)     | Finds the recruiter or hiring manager and drafts a message to each.      |
| New campaign on Upwork (`upwork-search`)     | Searches Upwork, drops low-quality clients, and ranks the rest.          |
| New campaign → Apply to links (`apply`)      | Checks the fit of each job link you paste, then applies.                 |
| Campaign → Resume (`resume-campaign`)        | Restarts a paused campaign and finishes its approved jobs.               |
| Campaign → Rescan skipped (`rescan-skipped`) | Checks skipped jobs again in case they were skipped by mistake.          |
| Campaign → Retry failed (`auto-apply`)       | Tries the failed applications again.                                     |
| Inbox → Scan pending (`scan-inbox`)          | Sorts new email, matches it to applications, suggests status changes.    |
| Networking → Regenerate (`networking`)       | Writes a new version of a draft message.                                 |
| Resume → Extract from PDF (`extract-resume`) | Reads an uploaded PDF into your resume editor.                           |
| Resume → Tailor (`tailor-resume`)            | Rewrites a copy of your resume for one job posting.                      |
| Upwork → Proposal (`upwork-proposal`)        | Drafts a proposal for one job.                                           |
| Upwork → Submit (`upwork-submit`)            | Sends a draft proposal after showing you the Connects cost.              |
| Upwork → Profile (`upwork-profile`)          | Suggests a better title, overview, and skills; saves them if you agree.  |
| Upwork → Inbox sync (`upwork-sync`)          | Brings in invitations, offers, messages, and your Connects balance.      |
| Pilot → Start (`pilot`)                      | Hands your whole job search to the agent until you stop it.              |

Some skills run in the middle of other work, and you never start them
yourself. The agent uses them to tailor your resume before applying, write a
cover letter, solve a captcha, or read a sign-in code from your email. The
[full list](https://jobpilot.suxrobgm.net/docs/campaigns-and-skills) covers
every skill.

Reading replies, picking up sign-in codes, and sending networking emails all
need a Google OAuth client that you create. The
[email setup guide](https://jobpilot.suxrobgm.net/docs/email-setup) walks you
through it.
